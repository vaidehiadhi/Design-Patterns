# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of various design patterns implemented in Java. These patterns are categorized into three main types: Behavioral, Creational, and Structural.

## Table of Contents

1. Behavioral Design Patterns
2. Creational Design Patterns
3. Structural Design Patterns

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, how they interact, and how responsibilities are distributed.

### Observer Pattern

**Use Case**: Weather station notifying multiple displays about changes in weather conditions.

### Strategy Pattern

**Use Case**: Navigation system using different algorithms to calculate routes.

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### Singleton Pattern

**Use Case**: Logging system with a single instance across the application.

**Use Case**: Document creation system for different types of documents (Word, PDF).


## Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns deal with object composition and how to assemble objects into larger structures.

### Adapter Pattern

**Use Case**: System using a third-party library with a different interface for payment processing.

### Composite Pattern

**Use Case**: File system where files and directories need to be treated uniformly.

## Usage

Each design pattern example includes a `Main` class that demonstrates how to use the pattern. To run an example, compile and run the corresponding `Main` class.
